    <title>Rogue</title>
    <p1>The Rogue's Strength and Magic attributes are intermediate between the Warrior and the Sorcerer, but with a Vitality being a bit lower than that of a Warrior and on par with a Sorcerer's, however her Dexterity is much higher than that of the aforementioned two classes. She is the only character class who can use Bows effectively, since the other two classes lack the dexterity needed for higher Bow Damage and To Hit percentage and are innately slow at firing Missiles. The quantity of Arrows is infinite which means that they will never take an end until the bow itself breaks down, unless it is an Indestructible one that is and it is of great advantage for her, especially since she uses bows frequently if she's not up for a Shields-and-Swords setup that is. Rogue's strength is mostly used for wearing heavy Plate Armor since her damage comes as most from her Dexterity, nevertheless Strength combined with the formerly mentioned attribute from equipment gives her quite of an increase in damage.

    Rogues are not as effective in team games, since allies can cause damage to one another even with Player Friendly set on. For example; if a Warrior is attacking, then the Rogue has to accurately target the monster to avoid hitting the Warrior. The only saving grace a Warrior has from accidental damage is his Shield; since there is not a hard cap on Blocking, if he were to have enough Dexterity he would be able to block the most of a Rogue's arrows, if not every arrow she fires as long as he is immobile.
