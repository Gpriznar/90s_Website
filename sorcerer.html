    Sorcerers are a playable class in Diablo I. They are the game's most effective spell casters. Since they have the highest maximum magic out of all character classes, they can effectively use the high-end spells. These high-end spells require more than just a level one proficiency. With the sorcerer's high mana, the class can use spells repeatedly, and the class has a higher casting rate than the other classes.

    The Sorcerer's skill should be used in moderation, recharging a staff of mana can be handy for saving gold, but every time the staff is recharged the max number of charges is lowered by 1. This is unideal if you have a lot of gold and in higher levels where it's good to have more charges on your staves.
